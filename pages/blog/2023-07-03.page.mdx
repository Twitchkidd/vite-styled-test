Good **morning** lovebugs!

Clocking in early today! 1:56! Dawa's been walked, I've had coffee, medication, and apparently instead of continuing with the calorie restriction from early yesterday, late-night me's body decided that if this is what days are going to look like, it'd better eat that pasta dish that dad's girlfriend sent (thanks, Tenise,) and the neighbors have been bumping bass since midnight, so I'm fueled and up, and had better figure this bug out.

First, I just have to say, six mdx files? I genuinely thought of rebooting the blog today if I figured the production bug out, and I thought, no, it's already in git, and I've only made like two posts anyway. Five. Welcome to ADHD. It's a legit nightmare, every day. Earlier, before the medication kicked in, I was trying to remember to check the fitness center for the charger while out with Dawa, and the amount it was just like that viral video 'life with ADHD' or whatever, with the thoughts visualized ...

Hold on, Dawa is being a lot right now ...

Okay, he just needed some love. And I needed to take a break from the glasses, they're great for a second, but I'm not really spending a lot of time actually _looking_ at the text when I'm _writing,_ I just check in to make sure I get the spelling right, especially in this window of time I can get nauseous if I'm wearing them too long.

Story time, I realized I needed glasses when I couldn't read what was on the cups any more. See, at Starbucks, before the sticker machines, we'd write people's drink orders and names and sometimes fun messages on their cups with sharpies, until we decided that making sure people could write was less important than profit, or something, and when I was on bar (espresso bar, like 'person making drinks,') I could only read the cups in the queue if I was on the right bar, otherwise I'd have to lean over, check out what the drink was, start making it, then go back for the cup, then I'd lean over to look at my next drink, and then go for the cup, and my fellow partners (employees) on bar would be like, "What are you doing?" and I'd be like, "... Oh."

So I went and got tested and seeing detail at distance for the first time in years is a truly wild experience, and also, I got the, literally the most, literally the glasses that made me "look most feminine." That's what I told the person! I have a little friggen ditty that goes off in my head now, "times I should'a known I was trans," and it's getting a little like those jokes that stop being funny after a while.

Okay, so, most jokes, that one's on me.

But like the "today's gender is ..." joke, where I posted sometimes artistic, sometimes related to current events, sometimes just random things from my life, all in the format of "Today's gender is ..." blank, where blank was anything. For _months_ before I realized I was trans, like every day I made this little joke.

Or five or six years ago, now, when I expressed to my coworker, "I sometimes wonder if I'm trans."

She said, "I do too."

Or the tutu, when I was five or six years old.

Well, guess what? Turns out like thirty years later, I still love clothes, and I'm going to dress glamorously. Didn't beat _that_ out of me, patriarchy.

Oh, computer programming, right.

Okay, now I have to bring this up, do I really want to do this computer thing?

Okay, definitely over a medical career, _that's_ for sure. ... _Mom._

I do need to be reframing it, though, because yea, it used to be part of an icky masculinity (btw heard the term 'masc mask' recently, spot on!) that was engendered in me, but I've learned to express myself with coding, actually, and in the right hands, it can be a tool for good, and it's not like the other side _isn't_ going to use it, so we really need the people who are willing to code and teach code for the light.

Literally, if I bring the wrong energy to a computer, I get sick to my stomach. Love and light or no clickity-clackity foo bar baz, none of that.

## Computer

OOhhkay, in the right mindset. Let us compute.

Currently hacking on Daphne, the Raspberry Pi 400, which is the most wonderful machine I think I have ever owned. Not the most powerful, by some metrics, but if we measure by how much it moves the mind, then powerful indeed.

Ok the website, though.

- Is it that there's styled-components in PageShell?
- Is it styled-components in the components directory outside any of the vite directories?
- Is it how I'm exporting from them?
- Is it one of the other plugins (mdx or Unfonts?)
- Is it that we added type of module to package.json and edited the server file?
- Is it that there's something between the plugins option and the ssr option?

... aside, _what the fuck,_ New London?

Okay, [test repo pushed.](https://gitlab.com/twitchkidd/vite-styled-test)

Interesting, I had to go over that list while mousing over the folder structure to really get it.

- styled in PageShell
- styled in components directory
- styled exported as named or default

- type module and edit server

- add mdx
- add Unfonts
- rearrange options

I just got the weirdest behavior. So, adding to PageShell does not break it, but I had to run `yarn prod` _twice_ before a refresh showed changes. So weird!
